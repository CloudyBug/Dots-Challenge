# Too much text!
A simple stenography challenge

## Flag
Flag: fr8Bnx1kMI

## Briefing
This image seems to be hiding a code, but its way longer than it should be! Can you work it out?

By wye.

## Infrastructure
The challenge is simply an image file. 

## Risks
The challenge is all run client side and only needs an image to be put on a webpage, so i cannot see any risks. 

## Walkthrough:
The long string of text provided has certian characters marked out by transparent pixels. These characters make up the flag.
To extract the flag, you need to load the image into some kind of editing software over a bright background to make the transparent pixels show up better, and then find all of the marked characters.
